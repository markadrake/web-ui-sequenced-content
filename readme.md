# Web UI: Sequenced Content

_Sequenced content_ is synonymous with terms like slider, carousel, or pagination. There are many techniques and solutions for displaying content in this manner - so why not create a repo with examples?

> I appreciate constructive feedback so [please open an issue](https://github.com/markadrake/web-ui-sequenced-content/issues).

## Focus of This Project

1. Identify UI patterns around sequenced / sequential content display.
2. Provide a working prototype of the pattern.
3. Prototypes are coded in standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We aren't going to bring in any front end frameworks or libraries.
4. Prototypes are provided as "best effort" solutions. The goal is to provide inspiration and provide a foundation to build upon, not production ready and battle-tested code.
