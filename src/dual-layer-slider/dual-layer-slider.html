				<hr>
				<p>Millions of CAPTCHAs are solved by people every day. reCAPTCHA makes positive use of this human effort by channeling
					the time spent solving CAPTCHAs into digitizing text, annotating images, and building machine learning datasets. This
					in turn helps preserve books, improve maps, and solve hard AI problems.</p>

					<br> Improve a map.</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>reCAPTCHA improves our knowledge of the physical world by creating CAPTCHAs out of text visible on Street View imagery.
					As people verify the text in these CAPTCHAs, this information is used to make Google Maps more precise and complete.
					So if you're a Google Maps user, your experience (and everyone else's) will be even better.</p>
