					<h2 class="heading">Hail Protection and More</h2>
					<p>Available in a wide variety of designs, our Cantilever structures provide protection from hail events and the harmful effects of the sun’s UV rays. Additionally, the nature of a cantilevered design places the structural support columns away from drive lanes and parking spaces, enabling vehicles and pedestrians to move about the covered area without worry of striking structural support columns.</p>

					<p>OEM and outbound vehicle logistics facilities considering the installation of hail protection can now count solar energy production as an added benefit with the introduction of VPS’ solar-enabled hail protection products. These facilities no longer have to utilize valuable land area to install solar farms. Instead, our VPS Protector Series structures can be outfitted with solar arrays, providing clients with the best of both worlds: industry-lead.</p>
