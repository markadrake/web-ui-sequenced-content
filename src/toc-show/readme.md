# About the Author

Hi I'm **Mark Drake**!

I believe front-end is fun and I'm here to convince you of it too! Front-end is a dynamic field and thus very rewarding. The skills you learn are in high-demand, and mastery provides a solid foundation for you to transition to more rewarding roles.

You can find me on in a couple of other places: [My Blog](https://markadrake.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/themarkdrake), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markadrake/).
