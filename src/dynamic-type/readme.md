## What is Dynamic Text Anyways?

This has been a pattern for a couple of years now.

I particularly like this pattern for adding personality to a message. You get to fit the context of the surrounding text to the user you expect to be reading it.

It's also an opportunity to provide a little motion and animation to an otherwise boring screen. I commonly see this used in a large block of content were a slider or carousel was once used.

Sliders and carousels have been a topic of debate over the last couple of years due. Analytics help us measure much more than traffic - and we can see the engagement rates with carousels once properly setup. This has certainly been on the decline, as users become more savvy the trend has been to neglect anything in this area. So we look to other opportunities to craft our messages and promotions.

So try adding a large, personable content block!

## Changes You Might Make

- Variable speed between deleting characters and typing characters would add to the realism. Consider adding or subtracting a randomized amount of ms off from each iteration.

- Consider increasing the pause duration based on how long the word is.

- For production you may want to consider pausing the entire loop until the content block is scrolled into view. Then add a delay, giving the user some time to scan the content prior to starting the loop.

- I really wanted to use promises here to tighten up the code and make it look pretty.
